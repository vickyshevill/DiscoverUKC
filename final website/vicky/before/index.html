            The hope for this page is to give you some useful advice on 
            what to do before coming to UKC. Before I give you that advice, 
            I want to say that most likely you are nervous and worried about 
            moving away from home, possible for the first time. I want to tell 
            you that ok and normal. Everyone is scared when they come to university 
            or any big change happens. I know I was and the best advice I got was 
            remember that everyone is in the same boat as you so go make friends
             and have fun. And don’t worry about making a fool of yourself. You won’t!

            OK, so now I will give you some actual tips of things you should do 
            before coming to Canterbury. First, you should get your accommodation
             all sort out, either living on campus or off. In my opinion, in the 
             first year, you should live on campus as its less stressful and 
             easier to go to events on campus. Once you have the accommodation 
             sorted you should join the freshers' Facebook page to find your 
             housemates so you can get to know them before you arrive at UKC. 
             Next thing to think about is your finances, you don’t want to 
             spend all your money in the first week so you should make a 
             weekly budget. Remember to include extra money for going out, 
             especially for freshers’ week.

            Before coming to Canterbury, you may want to decide if you would 
            like to get a uni rider bus pass, this allows you to take any bus 
            in Canterbury and some parts of Kent for a year. So, if you are 
            planning to take a bus to town a lot for shopping or nights out. 
            You want to get a bus pass however they are £100 plus for the year 
            so think about it carefully. So, I hope this advice helps you when 
            you start your UKC story and when you get here check out are During
             University page. For more tips and place you should go when you are 
             in Canterbury.
