            The Kent union does this amazing initiative where you can donate 
            food to the foodbank to support other students who need a little 
            helping hand. There is also an Upcycle scheme which allows you to 
            donate pretty much anything from bedding to pots and pans. If you 
            donâ€™t know what upcycling it is is basically taking other student 
            donations and instead of them going into landfills, they are given 
            away for free to students who really need them. These donations can 
            be dropped off during the many collection and donation events throughout 
            the year. Just check the student union for more information.
